Credit Card Fraud Detection using Support Vector Machines
This repository contains Python code for a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions using support vector machines (SVM).

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Prerequisites
The following libraries are required to run the code:

Pandas

Numpy

Scikit-learn

Running the code
To run the code, download the creditcard.csv dataset and save it to your local machine. Then, open the svm_credit_card_fraud_detection.py file in a Python IDE of your choice and update the file path to the creditcard.csv file. Then, run the script.

Output
When the script is run, the SVM model is trained on the dataset and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix are calculated. These metrics are printed to the console
